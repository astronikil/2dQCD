# 2dQCD

This is a fortran based code suite for SU(Nc) gauge theory coupled to fermions in two-dimensions.

The code suite consists of subroutines that can be put together to construct 
1. Hybrid Monte Carlo 
2. Dirac eigenvalue measurement
3. Meson spectroscopy -- 2-point, 3-point function

The header files are contained in the directory ./headers/ . The file size.h contains all the parameters.
